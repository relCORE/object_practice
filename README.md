#Project Title: Object Practice!#

##Reason why you're doing this: I've created this project to further my understanding of Objects in Javascript##
##The goal being to create an object consisting of 10 properties, to create an example of the object, and then to print the object in Human Readable form##  
##Reason why you chose to model this team as an object: The idea behind creating the team as an object is to be able to call all information about the team via one variable name, and to create reusable code for additional teams in the future to provide scalability##  

##Output: The code will console log out all 10 properties of the object representing the team in a human readable format##  
##Example Output:
